# Bright Network Job Recommender - Interview Task

A simple job recommendation application designed to be extensible and easy to use. To get started with running it, follow the instructions below.

## Getting started

Ensure you are running the solution on the correct Node version (v22.14.0) by running

```sh
nvm install && nvm use
```

If you do not have nvm installed, ensure your `node --version` returns v22.X.X or install [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-and-updating) using instructions for your OS. Other node versions may work but that's not guaranteed.

Next, run

```sh
npm ci
```

to install the necessary node modules (as defined in the package-lock.json file)

Then, to run the application, use

```sh
npm start
```
